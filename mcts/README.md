## CS238 Project 2^11
### Katherine Wu, Simon Tao, Nathaniel Goenawan

Developed an AI agent to play 2048 using a Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm. We evaluated based on three different value functions: merge score, largest tile in on the board, and sum of all the tile on the final board. We found that the best evaluation policy was the sum of all the tile on the file board gave us the highest percentage of achieving the tile 2048. 

For more information, you can read the details about the project from the CS238 2048 Paper.pdf if interested.
